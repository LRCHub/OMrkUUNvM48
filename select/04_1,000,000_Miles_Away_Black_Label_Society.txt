Sailing across my ocean
Sailing across my sea
I fill my up with hope Lord
I drown in empty misery

Sailing across my heaven
Sailing across my star
Until I find the voice I've been hearing in my head
Forever couldn't be too far
Forever couldn't be too far, yeah
Oh it couldn't be to far
Ooh it couldn't be to far

The cold wind blows
Like a leaf on a tree
I can feel myself falling lord
I need your guiding hand to catch me
When you hear yourself this song
I hope it brings yourself a smile
The times we had we thought would last forever
But forever only lasts a little while

Forever only lasts a little while, yeah
Oh, just a little while
Oh, just a little while
Loneliness my friend
I'll think about you every day, yeah
I sail into, into the light, oh yeah
Lord, one million miles away, oh yeah
One million miles away

Loneliness my friend
I'll think about you every day
As I sail, sail Lord into the light, oh yeah
Lord, Lord one million miles away, oh yeah
One million miles away
One million miles away, yeah

Ooh oh oh
Ooh oh oh

I.
The moon is sparkling silver
So high over him
The air is standing still
He will make it, yes he will

He believes in his body
In himself
When he dives

His needs
Perfection
His speed

1.000.000 TIMES FORWARD
1.000.000 TIMES DANGER ON HIS BACK
1.000.000 TIMES FORWARD
1.000.000 TIMES INTO THE SKY

II.
The sun is sparkling gold
And the secret is still untold he knows
There's so much more to learn - to fly
Will he ever have the time

He believes in his body
In himself
When he flies

His needs
Perfection
His speed

There's more in my life he says
There's more on my mind he says
No limits for me
